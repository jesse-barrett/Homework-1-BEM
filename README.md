# hw1-BEM
 
My page is loosely based on https://www.cicentral.net/, my local church website from back home. I wish I could have gotten more of it worked out, but I had a very busy weekend and didn't get the chance to work out all the finer details. The original site has a few usability issues that I tried to overlook, but I mainly focused on trying to get the Block Element Model down.

At the time I'm turning this in, I'm incapable of downloading Pulse Secure on my wifi and still meeting the deadline, so as a temporary workaround, I'm going to use GitHub Pages and add the web4 link as soon as I get back to campus tomorrow.
